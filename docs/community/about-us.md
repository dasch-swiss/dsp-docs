# About us

Since 2017, the Data and Service Center for the Humanities (DaSCH) has been a member of the Swiss Academy of Humanities and Social Sciences. The main task of the institution is to operate a platform for humanities research data that ensures access to this data. In addition, the networking of data with other databases is to be promoted (linked open data), thus creating added value for research and the interested public.
