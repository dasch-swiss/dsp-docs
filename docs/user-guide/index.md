# User Guide

This is the documentation for the generic Knora web application of the Data and Service Center for Humanities DaSCH. You can reach the app on
**[app2.dasch.swiss](https://app2.dasch.swiss)**.

## Getting started

Knora Web App is an intuitive, easy to use web-based application placed on top of [Knora](developers/knora/documentation/index.md) to directly use its powerful data management functionalities. With this modern web application, the researchers will be able to add data models, search, browse, and work with their qualitative data as easily as they could with a desktop data management tool. In addition, data models and data will automatically follow accepted standards, be interoperable, findable, and re-usable. Researchers and scholars with small data sets will have access to long-term accessibility to keep their research data alive, guaranteeing longevity of the data.
