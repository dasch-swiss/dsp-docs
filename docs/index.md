# DaSCH Service Platform Documentation

Welcome to DaSCH, the Swiss National Data and Service Center for the Humanities (DaSCH)!

Our mission is to operate a platform for Humanities research data
that ensures long-term availability of this data.

We operate the necessary infrastructures (a so called "keep-alive" archive)
and support researchers in using this infrastructure.
In order to reach this goal, DaSCH develops various software tools that are documented here:

- [DSP-APP](DSP-APP/): The web application that allows you to view and edit data in your browser
- [DSP-API](DSP-API/): The core of our software stack: the RDF database that offers an access via API
- [DSP-TOOLS](DSP-TOOLS/): A Python library and command line tool to upload data models and big data sets to a DSP server

## Quick start for researchers

If you are a researcher, you're probably most interested in the usage of the generic web application.
In this case, please have a look at our [DSP-APP user guide](DSP-APP/user-guide/).
