# DaSCH Service Platform Documentation

Welcome to DaSCH - Swiss National Data and Service Center for the Humanities!

Our mission is to operate a platform for Humanities research data
that ensures long-term availability of this data.

We operate the necessary infrastructure (a so called "keep-alive" archive)
and support researchers in using this infrastructure.
This is done with various open source software tools, all developed in-house.

Our software consists of 3 main components, which are documented here:

- [DSP-APP](DSP-APP/index.md): The web application that allows you to view and edit data in your browser
- [DSP-API](DSP-API/): The core of our software stack: the RDF database that offers an access via API
- [DSP-TOOLS](DSP-TOOLS/index.md): A command line tool to upload data models and big data sets to a DSP server

!!! tip "Quick start for researchers"

    If you are a researcher, you're probably most interested in the usage of the generic web application.<br/>
    In this case, have a look at our [DSP-APP user guide](DSP-APP/user-guide/index.md).

Do you want to install and use DSP locally?
Learn more about how to get started and how you can contribute to our software tools
on the [developers page](developers/getting-started.md).
