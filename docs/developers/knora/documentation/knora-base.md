# Knora-base ontology

<br>

Knora has a [base ontology](../02-knora-ontologies/knora-base.html), i.e. a data model, with pre-defined basic data types. In addition to this base ontology, each project can create its own data model which is capable to describe the types of items it wishes to store. Project specific ontologies **must** be extensions of the Knora base ontology.

The Knora-base ontology is identified by the IRI `http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-base`. In our documents it will be identified by the prefix `knora-base` or simply `kb`.
