# Knora-ui modules

## User Interface Modules for Knora

The Knora-ui modules are published on [npmJS](https://www.npmjs.com/~knora).

The modules helps to create a graphical user interface, a web application to use [Knora](https://www.knora.org) in a quick and simple way. The modules are written in Typescript in order to use them with [Angular](https://angular.io) (version 8). The components and directives are styled with [Angular Material](https://material.angular.io).

However, you can start only with [@knora/core](/developers/knora-ui/documentation/core/index-core) which contains the basic elements to build and connect your application to the Knora web API. Knora is a software framework for storing, sharing, and working with primary sources and data in the humanities.
