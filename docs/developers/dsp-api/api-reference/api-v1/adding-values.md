# Adding a Value

In order to add values to an existing resource, the HTTP method `POST`
has to be used. The request has to be sent to the Knora server using the
`values` path segment. Creating values requires authentication since
only known users may add values.

## Adding a Property Value

In order to add a value to a resource, its property type, value, and
project has to be indicated in the JSON. Also the IRI of the resource
the new value belongs has to be provided in the JSON.

```
HTTP POST to http://host/v1/values
```

  - Depending on the type of the new value, one of the following formats
    (all TypeScript interfaces defined in module `addValueFormats`) has
    to be used in order to create a new value:
    
      - `addRichtextValueRequest`
      - `addLinkValueRequest`
      - `addIntegerValueRequest`
      - `addDecimalValueRequest`
      - `addBooleanValueRequest`
      - `addUriValueRequest`
      - `addDateValueRequest` (see `dateString` in
        `basicMessageComponents` for the date format)
      - `addColorValueRequest`
      - `addGeometryValueRequest`
      - `addHierarchicalListValueRequest`
      - `addintervalValueRequest`
      - `addGeonameValueRequest`

## Response on Value Creation

When a value has been successfully created, Knora sends back a JSON with
the new value's IRI. The value IRI identifies the value and can be used
to perform future Knora API V1 operations.

The JSON format of the response is described in the TypeScript interface
`addValueResponse` in module `addValueFormats`.
