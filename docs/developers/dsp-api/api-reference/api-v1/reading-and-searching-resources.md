# Reading and Searching Resources

In order to get an existing resource, the HTTP method `GET` has to be
used. The request has to be sent to the Knora server using the
`resources` path segment (depending on the type of request, this segment
has to be exchanged, see below). Reading resources may require
authentication since some resources may have restricted viewing
permissions.

## Get the Representation of a Resource by its IRI

### Simple Request of a Resource (full Resource Request)

A resource can be obtained by making a GET request to the API providing
its IRI. Because a Knora IRI has the format of a URL, its IRI has to be
URL encoded.

In order to get the resource with the IRI
`http://rdfh.ch/c5058f3a` (an incunabula book contained in the
test data), make a HTTP GET request to the resources route (path segment
`resources` in the API call) and append the URL encoded
    IRI:

````
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resources/http%3A%2F%2Frdfh.ch%2Fc5058f3a
````

More formalized, the URL looks like this:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resources/resourceIRI
```

As an answer, the client receives a JSON that represents the
requested resource. It has the following members:

* `status`: The Knora status code, `0` if everything went well
* `userdata`: Data about the user that made the request
* `resinfo`: Data describing the requested resource and its class
* `resdata`: Short information about the resource and its class
  (including information about the given user's permissions on the
  resource)
* `incoming`: Resources pointing to the requested resource
* `props`: Properties of the requested resource.

For a complete and more formalized description of a full resource
request, look at the TypeScript interface `resourceFullResponse` in the
module `resourceResponseFormats`.

#### Provide Request Parameters

To make a request more specific, the following parameters can be
appended to the URL (`http://www.knora.org/resources/resourceIRI?param1=value1&param2=value2`):

- `reqtype=info|context|rights`: Specifies the type of
  request.

    - Setting the parameter's to value `info` returns short
      information about the requested resource (contains only
      `resinfo` and no properties, see TypeScript interface
      `resourceInfoResponse` in module
      `resourceResponseFormats`).

    - Setting the parameter's value to `context` returns
      context information (`resource_context`) about the
      requested resource: Either the dependent parts of a
      compound resource (e.g. pages of a book) or the parent
      resource of a dependent resource (e.g. the book a pages
      belongs to). By default, a context query does not return
      information about the requested resource itself, but
      only about its context (see TypeScript interface
      `resourceContextResponse` in module
      `resourceResponseFormats`). See below how to get
      additional information about the resource.

    - The parameter `rights` returns only the given user's
      permissions on the requested resource (see TypeScript
      interface `resourceRightsResponse` in module
      `resourceResponseFormats`).

- `resinfo=true`: Can be used in combination with
  `reqtype=context`: If set, `resinfo` is added to the response
  representing information about the requested resource
  (complementary to its context), see TypeScript interface
  `resourceContextResponse` in module `resourceResponseFormats`.

### Obtain an HTML Representation of a Resource

In order to get an HTML representation of a resource (not a JSON), the
path segment `resources.html` can be
    used:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resources.html/resourceIRI?reqtype=properties
```

The request returns the properties of the requested resource as an HTML
document.

### Get only the Properties belonging to a Resource

In order to get only the properties of a resource without any other
information, the path segment `properties` can be used:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/properties/resourceIRI
```

The JSON contains just the member `properties` representing the
requested resource's properties (see TypeScript interface
`resourcePropertiesResponse` in module `resourceResponseFormats`).

## Get Information about a Resource Class

### Get a Resource Class by its IRI

In order to get information about a resource class, the path segment
`resourcetypes` can be used. Append the IRI of the resource class to the
URL (e.g. `http://www.knora.org/ontology/0803/incunabula#book`).

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resourcetypes/resourceClassIRI
```

In the JSON, the information about the resource class and all the
property types that it may have are returned. None of
these are actual instances of a property, but only types (see TypeScript
interface `resourceTypeResponse` in module `resourceResponseFormats`).

### Get all the Property Types of a Resource Class or a Vocabulary

To get a list of all the available property types, the path segment
`propertylists` can be used. It can be restricted to a certain vocbulary
using the parameter `vocabulary` or to a certain resource class using
the parameter `restype`.

```
# returns all the property types for incunabula:page
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/propertylists?restype=resourceClassIRI

# returns all the property types for the incunabula vocabulary
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/propertylists?vocabulary=vocabularyIRI
```

Both of these queries return a list of property types. The default value
for the parameter `vocabulary` is `0` and means that the resource
classes from all the available vocabularies are returned. See TypeScript
interface `propertyTypesInResourceClassResponse` in module
`resourceResponseFormats`.

### Get the Resource Classes of a Vocabulary

Resource classes and property types are organized in (project specific)
name spaces, so called vocabularies. In order to get all the resource
classes defined for a specific vocabulary (e.g. `incunabula`), the
parameter `vocabulary` has to be used and assigned the vocabulary's IRI:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resourcetypes?vocabulary=vocabularyIRI
```

This returns all the resource classes defined for the specified
vocabulary and their property types. The default value for the parameter
`vocabulary` is `0` and means that the resource classes from all the
available vocabularies are returned. See TypeScript interface
`resourceTypesInVocabularyResponse` in module `resourceResponseFormats`.

## Get all the Vocabularies

To get a list of all available vocabularies, the path segment
`vocabularies` can be used:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/vocabularies
```

The response will list all the available vocabularies. See TypeScript
interface `vocabularyResponse` in module `resourceResponseFormats`.

## Search for Resources

### Search for Resources by their Label

This is a simplified way for searching for resources just by their label. 
Search by label automatically adds Lucene operators, 
search strings are expected not to contain any characters with a special meaning in 
[Lucene Query Parser syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html).

It is a simple string-based method:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/resources?searchstr=searchValue
```

Additionally, the following parameters can be appended to the URL (search value is `Zeitglöcklein`):

- `restype_id=resourceClassIRI`: This restricts the search to
  resources of the specified class (subclasses of that class will
  also match). `-1` is the default value and means no restriction
  to a specific class. If a resource class IRI is specified, it
  has to be URL encoded (e.g.
  `http://www.knora.org/v1/resources?searchstr=Zeitgl%C3%B6cklein&restype_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23book`).

- `numprops=Integer`: Specifies the number of properties returned
  for each resource that was found (sorted by GUI order), e.g.
  `http://www.knora.org/v1/resources?searchstr=Zeitgl%C3%B6cklein&numprops=4`.

- `limit=Integer`: Limits the amount of results returned (e.g.
  `http://www.knora.org/v1/resources?searchstr=Zeitgl%C3%B6cklein&limit=1`).

The response lists the resources that matched the search criteria (see
TypeScript interface `resourceLabelSearchResponse` in module
`resourceResponseFormats`).

### Fulltext Search

Knora offers a fulltext search that searches through all textual
representations of values. The search terms have to be URL encoded.
Fulltext search supports the [Lucene Query Parser syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html).
Note that Lucene's default operator is a logical OR when submitting several search terms.

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/search/searchValue?searchtype=fulltext[&filter_by_restype=resourceClassIRI]
[&filter_by_project=projectIRI][&show_nrows=Integer]{[&start_at=Integer]
```

The parameter `searchtype` is required and has to be set to
`fulltext`. Additionally, these parameters can be set:

- `filter_by_restype=resourceClassIRI`: restricts the search to
  resources of the specified resource class (subclasses of that
  class will also match).
- `filter_by_project=projectIRI`: restricts the search to
  resources of the specified project.
- `show_nrows=Integer`: Indicates how many reults should be
  presented on one page. If omitted, the default value `25` is
  used.
- `start_at=Integer`: Used to enable paging and go through all the
  results request by request.

The response presents the retrieved resources (according to `show_nrows`
and `start_at`) and information about paging. If not all resources could
be presented on one page (`nhits` is greater than `shown_nrows`), the
next page can be requested (by increasing `start_at` by the number of
`show_nrows`). You can simply go through the elements of `paging` to
request the single pages one by one. See TypeScript interface
`searchResponse` in module `searchResponseFormats`.

### Extended Search for Resources

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/search/?searchtype=extended
[&filter_by_restype=resourceClassIRI][&filter_by_project=projectIRI][&filter_by_owner=userIRI]
(&property_id=propertyTypeIRI&compop=comparisonOperator&searchval=searchValue)+
[&show_nrows=Integer][&start_at=Integer]
```

The parameter `searchtype` is required and has to be set to
`extended`. An extended search requires at least one set of
parameters consisting of:

- `property_id=propertyTypeIRI`: the property the resource has to
  have (subproperties of that property will also match).

- `compop=comparisonOperator`: the comparison operator to be used
  to match between the resource's property value and the search
  term.

- `searchval=searchTerm`: the search value to look for.

You can also provide several of these sets to make your query more
specific.

The following table indicates the possible combinations of value types
and comparison
operators:

| Value Type       | Comparison Operator                                   |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| Date Value       | EQ, !EQ, GT, GT_EQ, LT, LT_EQ, EXISTS                 |
| Integer Value    | EQ, !EQ, GT, GT_EQ, LT, LT_EQ, EXISTS                 |
| Float Value      | EQ, !EQ, GT, GT_EQ, LT, LT_EQ, EXISTS                 |
| Text Value       | MATCH_BOOLEAN, MATCH, EQ, !EQ, LIKE, !LIKE, EXISTS    |
| Geometry Value   | EXISTS                                                |
| Resource Pointer | EQ, EXISTS                                            |
| Color Value      | EQ, EXISTS                                            |
| List Value       | EQ, EXISTS                                            |
| Boolean Value    | EQ, !EQ, EXISTS                                       |

Explanation of the comparison operators:

* `EQ`: checks if a resource's value *equals* the search value. In
  case of a text value type, it checks for identity of the strings
  compared. In case of a date value type, equality is given if the
  dates overlap in any way. Since dates are internally always
  treated as periods, equality is given if a date value's period
  ends after or equals the start of the defined period and a date
  value's period starts before or equals the end of the defined
  period.
* `!EQ`: checks if a resource's value *does not equal* the search
  value. In case of a text value type, it checks if the compared
  strings are different. In case of a date value type, inequality
  is given if the dates do not overlap in any way, meaning that a
  date starts after the end of the defined period or ends before
  the beginning of the defined period (dates are internally always
  treated as periods, see above).
* `GT`: checks if a resource's value is *greater than* the search
  value. In case of a date value type, it assures that a period
  begins after the indicated period's end.
* `GT_EQ`: checks if a resource's value *equals or is greater
  than* the search value. In case of a date value type, it assures
  that the periods overlap in any way (see `EQ`) **or** that the
  period starts after the indicated period's end (see `GT`).
* `LT`: checks if a resource's value is *lower than* the search
  value. In case of a date value type, it assures that a period
  ends before the indicated period's start.
* `LT_EQ`: checks if a resource's value *equals or is lower than*
  the search value. In case of a date value type, it assures that
  the periods overlap in any way (see `EQ`) **or** that the period
  ends before the indicated period's start (see `LT`).
* `EXISTS`: checks if an instance of the indicated property type
  *exists* for a resource. **Please always provide an empty search
  value when using EXISTS: "searchval="**. Otherwise, the query
  syntax rules would be violated.
* `MATCH`: checks if a resource's text value *matches* the search
  value. The behaviour depends on the used triplestore's full text
  index, see [Lucene Query Parser Syntax](https://lucene.apache.org/core/2_9_4/queryparsersyntax.html).
* `LIKE`: checks if the search value is contained in a resource's
  text value.
* `!LIKE`: checks if the search value is not contained in a
  resource's text value.
* `MATCH_BOOLEAN`: checks if a resource's text value *matches* the
  provided list of positive (exist) and negative (do not exist)
  terms. The list takes this form: `([+-]term\s)+`.

Additionally, these parameters can be set:

* `filter_by_restype=resourceClassIRI`: restricts the search to
  resources of the specified resource class (subclasses of that
  class will also match).
* `filter_by_project=projectIRI`: restricts the search to
  resources of the specified project.
* `filter_by_owner`: restricts the search to resources owned by
  the specified user.
* `show_nrows=Integer`: Indicates how many reults should be
  presented on one page. If omitted, the default value `25` is
  used.
* `start_at=Integer`: Used to enable paging and go through all the
  results request by request.

Some sample searches:

* `http://localhost:3333/v1/search/?searchtype=extended&filter_by_restype=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23book&property_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23title&compop=!EQ&searchval=Zeitgl%C3%B6cklein%20des%20Lebens%20und%20Leidens%20Christi`:
  searches for books that have a title that does not equal
  "Zeitglöcklein des Lebens und Leidens
  Christi".
* `http://www.knora.org/v1/search/?searchtype=extended&filter_by_restype=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23book&property_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23title&compop=MATCH&searchval=Zeitgl%C3%B6cklein&property_id=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.knora.org%2Fontology%2Fincunabula%23pubdate&compop=EQ&searchval=JULIAN:1490`:
  searches for resources of type `incunabula:book` whose titles
  match "Zeitglöcklein" and were published in the year 1490
  (according to the Julian calendar).

The response presents the retrieved resources (according to `show_nrows`
and `start_at`) and information about paging. If not all resources could
be presented on one page (`nhits` is greater than `shown_nrows`), the
next page can be requested (by increasing `start_at` by the number of
`show_nrows`). You can simply go through the elements of `paging` to
request the single pages one by one. See the TypeScript interface
`searchResponse` in module `searchResponseFormats`.

## Get a Graph of Resources

The path segment `graphdata` returns a graph of resources that are
reachable via links to or from an initial resource.

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/graphdata/resourceIRI?depth=Integer
```

The parameter `depth` specifies the maximum depth of the graph, and
defaults to 4. If `depth` is 1, the operation will return only the
initial resource and any resources that are directly linked to or from
it.

The graph includes any link that is a subproperty of
`knora-base:hasLinkTo`, except for links that are subproperties of
`knora-base:isPartOf`. Specifically, if resource `R1` has a link that is
a subproperty of `knora-base:isPartOf` pointing to resource `R2`, no
link from `R1` to `R2` is included in the graph.

The response represents the graph as a list of nodes (resources) and a
list of edges (links). For details, see the TypeScript interface
`graphDataResponse` in module `graphDataResponseFormats`.

## Get Hierarchical Lists

The knora-base ontology allows for the definition of hierarchical lists.
These can be queried by providing the IRI of the root node. Selections
are hierarchical list that are just one level deep. Internally, they are
represented as hierarchical lists.

You can get a hierarchical by using the path segment `hlists` and
appending the hierarchical list's IRI (URL encoded):

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/hlists/rootNodeIRI
```

The response shows all of the list nodes that are element of the
requested hierarchical list as a tree structure. See TypeScript
interface `hierarchicalListResponse` in module
`hierarchicalListResponseFormats`.

For each node, the full path leading to it from the top level can be
requested by making a query providing the node's IRI and setting the
param `reqtype=node`:

```
HTTP GET to http://host/v1/hlists/nodeIri?reqtype=node
```

The response presents the full path to the current node. See the TypeScript
interface `nodePathResponse` in module `hierarchicalListResponseFormats`.
