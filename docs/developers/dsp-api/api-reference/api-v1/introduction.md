# Introduction: Using API V1

## RESTful API

Knora API V1 is a RESTful API that allows for reading and adding of
resources from and to Knora and changing their values using HTTP
requests. The actual data is submitted as JSON (request and response
format). The diverse HTTP methods are applied according to the
widespread practice of RESTful APIs: GET for reading, POST for adding,
PUT for changing resources and values, and DELETE to delete resources or
values (see
[Using HTTP Methods for RESTful Services](http://www.restapitutorial.com/lessons/httpmethods.html)).

## Knora IRIs

Every resource that is created or hosted by Knora is identified by a
unique id, a so called Internationalized Resource Identifier (IRI). The
IRI is required for every API operation to identify the resource in
question. A Knora IRI has itself the format of a URL. For some API
operations, the IRI has to be URL-encoded (HTTP GET requests).

Unlike Knora API v2, Knora API v1 uses internal IRIs, i.e. the actual IRIs
that are stored in the triplestore (see [Knora IRIs](../api-v2/knora-iris.md)).

## V1 Path Segment

Every request to API V1 includes `v1` as a path segment, e.g.
`http://host/v1/resources/http%3A%2F%2Frdfh.ch%2Fc5058f3a`.
Accordingly, requests to another version of the API will require another
path segment.

## Knora API Response Format

In case an API request could be handled successfully, Knora responds
with a 200 HTTP status code. The actual answer from Knora (the
representation of the requested resource or information about the
executed API operation) is sent in the HTTP body, encoded as JSON (using
UTF-8). In this JSON, an API specific status code is sent (member
`status`).

The JSON formats are formally defined as TypeScript interfaces (located
in `salsah/src/typescript_interfaces`). Build the HTML documentation of
these interfaces by executing `make jsonformat` (see `docs/Readme.md`
for further instructions).

## Placeholder `host` in sample URLs

Please note that all the sample URLs used in this documentation contain
`host` as a placeholder. The placeholder `host` has to be replaced by
the actual hostname (and port) of the server the Knora instance is
running on.

## Authentication

For all API operations that target at changing resources or values, the
client has to provide credentials (username and password) so that the
API server can authenticate the user making the request. When using the
SALSAH web interface, after logging in a session is established (cookie
based). When using the API with another client application, credentials
can be sent as a part of the HTTP header or as parts of the URL (see
[Authentication in Knora](../../design/principles/authentication.md)).

Also when reading resources authentication my be needed as resources and
their values may have restricted view permissions.
