 be activated.

## Endpoint Overview

**List Item Operations:**

- `POST: /admin/lists` : create new list item (root or child node). To use activate: `new-list-admin-routes:1`.

- `GET: /admin/lists[?projectIri=<projectIri>]` : return all lists optionally filtered by project

### Create new item (entire list or a node)
To use activate: `new-list-admin-routes:1`.
  - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
  - POST: `/admin/lists`
  - BODY:
  
#### Create an entirely new list
The IRI of the project must be given in the body of the request to which the list 
is supposed to be attached. 
Further basic information about the list such as its `labels` and `comments` must also be provided. 
Optionally, the request body can contain a `name` for the list which must be unique in the project.

```json
    {
        "projectIri": "someprojectiri",
        "labels": [{ "value": "Neue Liste", "language": "de"}],
        "comments": []
    } 
```

Additionally, each list can have an optional custom IRI (of [Knora IRI](../api-v2/knora-iris.md#iris-for-data) form) specified by the `id` in the request body as below:

```json
  {
    "id": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
    "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001",
    "name": "a new list",
    "labels": [{ "value": "Neue Liste mit IRI", "language": "de"}],
    "comments": []
  }
```

The response will contain the basic information of the list, `listinfo` and an empty list of its children, as below:

```json
{
    "list": {
        "children": [],
        "listinfo": {
            "comments": [],
            "id": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
            "isRootNode": true,
            "labels": [
                {
                    "value": "Neue Liste mit IRI",
                    "language": "de"
                }
            ],
            "name": "a new list",
            "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001"
        }
    }
}
```

#### Create a new child node
The IRI of its parent node must be given in the request body by `parentNodeIri`. 
Furthermore, the request body should also contain the project IRI of the list and basic information of the node as below:
  
```json
     {   
         "parentNodeIri": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
         "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001",
         "name": "a child",
         "labels": [{ "value": "New List Node", "language": "en"}],
         "comments": []
    }
```

Additionally, each child node can have an optional custom IRI (of [Knora IRI](../api-v2/knora-iris.md#iris-for-data) form) specified by the `id` in the request body as below:

```json
{    "id": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-childNode",
     "parentNodeIri": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
     "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001",
     "name": "a child",
     "labels": [{ "value": "New List Node", "language": "en"}],
     "comments": []
}
```

The response will contain the basic information of the node, `nodeinfo`, as below:

```json
{
    "nodeinfo": {
        "comments": [],
        "hasRootNode": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
        "id": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-childNode",
        "labels": [
            {
                "value": "New List Node",
                "language": "en"
            }
        ],
        "name": "a new child",
        "position": 1
    }
}
```

The new node can be created and inserted in a specific position which must be given in the payload as shown below. If necessary, 
according to the given position, the sibling nodes will be shifted. Note that `position` cannot have a value higher than 
number of existing children.

```json
{   "parentNodeIri": "http://rdfh.ch/lists/0001/a-list",
    "projectIri": "http://rdfh.ch/projects/0001",
    "name": "Inserted new child",
    "position": 0,
    "labels": [{ "value": "New List Node", "language": "en"}],
    "comments": []
}
```

In case the new node should be appended to the list of current children, either `position: -1` must be given in the 
payload or the `position` parameter must be left out of the payload. 

### Update basic information (entire list or a node)
The basic information of a list or a node such as its labels, comments, name, or all of them can be updated. The parameters that 
must be updated together with the new value must be given in the JSON body of the request together with the IRI of the 
list item (root or child node) and the IRI of the project it belongs to. 

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update list information
 - Response:
     - If the IRI of the list (i.e. root node) is given, return basic information of the list, `listinfo` without children.
    - If the IRI of a child node is given, return basic information of the node, `nodeinfo`, without its children.
 - PUT: `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>`
 - BODY:
 
```json
   {
       "listIri": "listIri",
       "projectIri": "someprojectiri",
       "name": "a new name",
       "labels": [{ "value": "Neue geönderte Liste", "language": "de"}, { "value": "Changed list", "language": "en"}],
       "comments": [{ "value": "Neuer Kommentar", "language": "de"}, { "value": "New comment", "language": "en"}]
   }
```
If only name of the list must be updated, it can be given as below in the body of the request:

```json
   {
       "listIri": "listIri",
       "projectIri": "someprojectiri",
       "name": "another name"
  }
```

Alternatively, basic information `name`, `labels`, or `comments` or a list or a child node can be updated individually 
as explained below.

### Update list or node's name

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update name of the list (i.e. root node) or a child node whose IRI is specified by `<listItemIri>`.
 - PUT: `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>/name`
 - BODY:
 The new name of the node must be given in the body of the request as shown below:
 ```json
{
    "name": "a new name"
}
```
There is no need to specify the project IRI because it is automatically extracted using the given `<listItemIRI>`.

### Update list or node's labels

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update labels of the list (i.e. root node) or a child node whose IRI is specified by `<listItemIri>`.
 - PUT: `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>/labels`
 - BODY:
 The new set of labels of the node must be given in the body of the request as shown below:
 ```json
{
    "labels": [{"language": "se", "value": "nya märkningen"}]
}
```
There is no need to specify the project IRI because it is automatically extracted using the given `<listItemIRI>`.

### Update list or node's comments

 - Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
 - Update comments of the list (i.e. root node) or a child node whose IRI is specified by `<listItemIri>`.
 - PUT: `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>/labels`
 - BODY:
 The new set of comments of the node must be given in the body of the request as shown below:
 ```json
{
    "comments": [{"language": "se", "value": "nya kommentarer"}]
}
```
There is no need to specify the project IRI because it is automatically extracted using the given `<listItemIRI>`.

### Repositioning a child node

The position of an existing child node can be updated. The child node can be either repositioned within its 
current parent node, or can be added to another parent node in a specific position. The IRI of the parent node 
and the new position of the child node must be given in the request body. 

If a node is supposed to be repositioned to the end of a parent node's children, give `position: -1`.

Suppose a parent node `parentNode1` has five children in positions 0-4, to change the position of its child node 
`childNode4` from its original position 3 to position 1 the request body should specify the IRI of its parent node 
and the new position as below:
```json
   {
      "parentNodeIri": "<parentNode1-IRI>",
      "position": 1
  }
```

Then the node `childNode4` will be put in position 1, and its siblings will be shifted accordingly. The new position given 
in the request body cannot be the same as the child node's original position. If `position: -1` is given, the node will 
be moved to the end of children list, and its siblings will be shifted to left. In case of repositioning the node 
within its current parent, the maximum permitted position is the length of its children list, i.e. in this example the 
highest allowed position is 4.

To reposition a child node `childNode4` to another parent node `parentNode2` in a specific position, for 
example `position: 3`, the IRI of the new parent node and the position the node must be placed within children of 
`parentNode2` must be given as:

```json
   {
      "parentNodeIri": "<parentNode2-IRI>",
      "position": 3
  }
```

In this case, the `childNode4` is removed from the list of children of its old parent `parentNode1` and its old 
siblings are shifted accordingly. Then the node `childNode4` is added to the specified new parent, i.e. `parentNode2`, in 
the given position. The new siblings are shifted accordingly.

Note that, the furthest the node can be placed is at the end of the list of the children of `parentNode2`. That means 
if `parentNode2` had 3 children with positions 0-2, then `childNode4` can be placed in position 0-3 within children 
of its new parent node. If the `position: -1` is given, the node will be appended to the end of new parent's children, 
and new siblings will not be shifted. 

Values less than -1 are not permitted for parameter `position`.
 
- Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
- Response: returns the updated parent node with all its children.
- Put `/admin/lists/<nodeIri>/position`

### Delete a list or a node
An entire list or a single node of it can be completely deleted, if not in use. Before deleting an entire list 
(i.e. root node), the data and ontologies are checked for any usage of the list or its children. If not in use, the list 
and all its children are deleted.

Similarily, before deleting a single node of a list, it is verified that the node itself and none of its children are used.
If not in use, the node and all its children are deleted. Once a node is deleted, its parent node is updated by shifting the 
remaining child nodes with respect to the position of the deleted node. 

- Required permission: SystemAdmin / ProjectAdmin
- Response:
    - If the IRI of the list (i.e. root node) is given, the `iri` of the deleted list with a flag `deleted: true` is returned.
    - If the IRI of a child node is given, the updated parent node is returned.

- Delete `/admin/lists/<listItemIri>`
