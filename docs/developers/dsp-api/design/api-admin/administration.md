# Administration (Users, Projects, Groups, Institutions, Permissions)

## Scope

This Section includes management (creation, updating, deletion) of
*Users*, *Projects*, *Groups*, *Institutions*, and *Permissions*.

## Implementation

All administration functions will be implemented as part of the Knora
API in the `webapi` codebase. There is also a separate web-application
as part of the `salsah` codebase using this API, allowing basic
management operations.

## Overview

During the initial deployment of a Knora server, the main administration
user (*root*) is created. This *root* user has the right to do anything.

Knora’s concept of access control is that permissions can only be
granted to groups (or the whole project, i.e. all members of a project)
and not to individual users. There are two distinct ways of granting
permission. Firstly, an object (a resource or value) can grant
permissions to groups of users, and secondly, permissions can be granted
directly to a group of users (not bound to a specific object). There are
six built-in groups: *UnknownUser*, *KnownUser*, *Creator*,
*ProjectMember*, *ProjectAdmin*, and *SystemAdmin*. These groups can be
used in the same way as normal user created groups for permission
management, i.e. can be used to give certain groups of users, certain
permissions, without the need to explicitly create them.

A user becomes implicitly a member of such a group by satisfying certain
conditions:

  - **knora-admin:UnknownUser**:  
    Any user who has not logged into Knora is
    automatically assigned to this group.

  - **knora-admin:KnownUser**:  
    Any user who has logged into Knora is automatically
    assigned to this group.

  - **knora-admin:Creator**:  
    When checking a user’s permissions on an object, the user is
    automatically assigned to this group if he is the creator of the
    object.

  - **knora-admin:ProjectMember**:  
    When checking a user’s permissions, the user is automatically
    assigned to this group by being a member of a project designated by
    the `knora-admin:isInProject` property.

  - **knora-admin:ProjectAdmin**:  
    When checking a user's permission, the user is automatically
    assigned to this group through the
    `knora-admin:isInProjectAdminGroup` property, which points to the
    project in question.

  - **knora-admin:SystemAdmin**:  
    Membership is received by setting the property
    `knora-admin:isInSystemAdminGroup` to `true` on a `knora-admin:User`.

To use these build-in groups as values for properties (Object Access and
Default Permissions), the IRI is constructed by appending the name of
the built-in group to `knora-admin`, e.g., `knora-admin:KnownUser` where
`knora-admin` corresponds to `http://www.knora.org/ontology/knora-admin#`.

## Permissions

Up until know, we have mentioned two groups of permissions. The first
called *object access permissions*, which contains permissions that
point from explicit **objects** (resources/values) to groups. The second
group of permissions called *administrative permissions*, and which
contains permissions that are put on instances of
**knora-admin:Permission** objects directly affecting groups. There is
another, third group of permissions, called *default object access
permissions* which is also put on instances of *knora-admin:Permission*,
and which also directly affect groups.

### Object Access Permissions

An object (resource / value) can grant the following permissions, which
are stored in a compact format in a single string, which is the object
of the predicate `knora-base:hasPermissions`:

1.  **Restricted view permission (RV)**: Allows a restricted view of
    the object, e.g. a view of an image with a watermark.
2.  **View permission (V)**: Allows an unrestricted view of the
    object. Having view permission on a resource only affects the
    user’s ability to view information about the resource other than
    its values. To view a value, she must have view permission on the
    value itself.
3.  **Modify permission (M)**: For values, this permission allows a
    new version of a value to be created. For resources, this allows
    the user to create a new value (as opposed to a new version of an
    existing value), or to change information about the resource other
    than its values. When he wants to make a new version of a value,
    his permissions on the containing resource are not relevant.
    However, when he wants to change the target of a link, the old
    link must be deleted and a new one created, so he needs modify
    permission on the resource.
4.  **Delete permission (D)**: Allows the item to be marked as
    deleted.
5.  **Change rights permission (CR)**: Allows the permissions granted
    by the object to be changed.

Each permission in the above list implies all lower-numbered
permissions.

A user’s permission level on a particular object is calculated in
the following way:

1.  Make a list of the groups that the user belongs to, including
    Creator and/or ProjectMember and/or ProjectAdmin if applicable.
2.  Make a list of the permissions that she can obtain on the
    object, by iterating over the permissions that the object
    grants. For each permission, if she is in the specified group,
    add the specified permission to the list of permissions she can
    obtain.
3.  From the resulting list, select the highest-level permission.
4.  If the result is that she would have no permissions, give her
    whatever permission *UnknownUser* would have.

The format of the object of `knora-base:hasPermissions` is as
follows:

- Each permission is represented by the one-letter or two-letter
  abbreviation given above.
- Each permission abbreviation is followed by a space, then a
  comma-separated list of groups that the permission is granted
  to.
- The IRIs of built-in groups are shortened using the knora-admin
  prefix.
- Multiple permissions are separated by a vertical bar (|).

For example, if an object grants view permission to *unknown* and *known
users*, and modify permission to *project members*, the resulting
permission literal would be:
    :

    V knora-admin:UnknownUser,knora-admin:KnownUser|M knora-admin:ProjectMember

### Administrative Permissions

The following permissions can be set via instances of
`knora-admin:AdministrativePermission` on any group belonging to a
project. For users that are members of a number of groups with
administrative permissions attached, the final set of permissions is
additive and most permissive. The administrative permissions are stored
in a compact format in a single string, which is the object of the
predicate `knora-base:hasPermissions` attached to an instance of the
`knora-admin:AdministrativePermission` class. The following permission
values can be used:

1.  Resource / Value Creation Permissions:

    1)  **ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission**:

      - description: gives the permission to create resources
        inside the project.
      - usage: used as a value for *knora-base:hasPermissions*.

    2)  **ProjectResourceCreateRestrictedPermission**:

      - description: gives restricted resource creation permission
        inside the project.
      - usage: used as a value for *knora-base:hasPermissions*.
      - value: `RestrictedProjectResourceCreatePermission`
        followed by a comma-separated list of *ResourceClasses*
        the user should only be able to create instances of.

2.  Project Administration Permissions:

    1)  **ProjectAdminAllPermission**:

      - description: gives the user the permission to do anything
        on project level, i.e. create new groups, modify all
        existing groups (*group info*, *group membership*,
        *resource creation permissions*, *project administration
        permissions*, and *default permissions*).
      - usage: used as a value for *knora-base:hasPermissions*.

    2)  **ProjectAdminGroupAllPermission**:

      - description: gives the user the permission to modify
        *group info* and *group membership* on *all* groups
        belonging to the project.
      - usage: used as a value for the *knora-base:hasPermissions*
        property.

    3)  **ProjectAdminGroupRestrictedPermission**:

      - description: gives the user the permission to modify
        *group info* and *group membership* on *certain* groups
        belonging to the project.
      - usage: used as a value for *knora-base:hasPermissions*
      - value: `ProjectGroupAdminRestrictedPermission` followed by
        a comma-separated list of `knora-admin:UserGroup`.

    4)  **ProjectAdminRightsAllPermission**:

      - description: gives the user the permission to change the
        *permissions* on all objects belonging to the project
        (e.g., default permissions attached to groups and
        permissions on objects).
      - usage: used as a value for the *knora-base:hasPermissions*
        property.

3.  Ontology Administration Permissions:

    1)  **ProjectAdminOntologyAllPermission**:

      - description: gives the user the permission to administer
        the project ontologies
      - usage: used as a value for the *knora-base:hasPermissions*
        property.

The administrative permissions are stored in a compact format in a
single string, which is the object of the predicate
`knora-base:hasPermissions` attached to an instance of the
`knora-admin:AdministrativePermission` class.

  - The format of the object of `knora-base:hasPermissions` is as
    follows:

      - Each permission is represented by the name given above.
      - Each permission is followed by a space, then if applicable, by a
        comma separated list of IRIs, as defined above.
      - The IRIs of built-in values (e.g., built-in groups, resource
        classes, etc.) are shortened using the knora-admin prefix
        `knora-admin:`.
      - Multiple permissions are separated by a vertical bar (|).

For example, if an administrative permission grants the
`knora-admin:ProjectMember` group the permission to create all resources
(*ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission*), the resulting administrative
permission object with the compact form literal would be: :

```
<http://rdfh.ch/permissions/001
        rdf:type knora-admin:AdministrativePermission ;
        knora-admin:forProject <http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF>;
        knora-admin:forGroup knora-admin:ProjectMember ;
        knora-base:hasPermissions "ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission"^^xsd:string .
```

### Default Object Access Permissions

Default Object Access Permissions are used when new objects (resources
and/or values) are created. They represent object access permissions
with which the new object will be initially outfitted. As with
administrative permissions, these default object access permissions can
be defined for any number of groups. Additionally, they can be also
defined for resource classes and properties.

The following default object access permissions can be attached to
groups, resource classes and/or properties via instances of
*knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission* (described further bellow).
The default object access permissions correspond to the earlier
described object access permission:

1.  **Default Restricted View Permission (RV)**:

      - description: any object, created by a user inside a group
        holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission
      - value: `RV` followed by a comma-separated list of
        `knora-admin:UserGroup`

2.  **Default View Permission (V)**:

      - description: any object, created by a user inside a group
        holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission
      - value: `V` followed by a comma-separated list of
        `knora-admin:UserGroup`

3.  **Default Modify Permission (M)** accompanied by a list of groups.

      - description: any object, created by a user inside a group
        holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission
      - value: `M` followed by a comma-separated list of
        `knora-admin:UserGroup`

4.  **Default Delete Permission (D)** accompanied by a list of groups.

      - description: any object, created by a user inside a group
        holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission
      - value: `D` followed by a comma-separated list of
        `knora-admin:UserGroup`

5.  **Default Change Rights Permission (CR)** accompanied by a list of
    groups.

      - description: any object, created by a user inside a group
        holding this permission, is restricted to carry this permission
      - value: `CR` followed by a comma-separated list of
        `knora-admin:UserGroup`

A single instance of `knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission` must
always reference a project, but can only reference **either** a group
(`knora-admin:forGroup` property), a resource class
(`knora-admin:forResourceClass`), a property (`knora-admin:forProperty`),
or a combination of resource class **and** property.

Example default object access permission instance:

```
<http://rdfh.ch/permissions/002
        rdf:type knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission ;
        knora-admin:forProject <http://rdfh.ch/projects/00FF>;
        knora-admin:forGroup knora-admin:ProjectMember ;
        knora-base:hasPermissions "CR knora-admin:Creator|M knora-admin:ProjectMember|V knora-admin:KnownUser"^^xsd:string .
```

This instance is setting default object access permissions to the
project member group of a project, giving change right permission to the
creator, modify permission to all project members, and view permission
to known users. Further, this **implicitly** applies to all resource
classes and all their properties inside the project.

### Permission Precedence Rules

For both administrative permissions and default object access
permissions, the resulting permissions are derived by applying
precedence rules, for the case that the user is member of more than one
group.

The following list is sorted by the permission precedence level in
descending order:

  - permissions on `knora-admin:ProjectAdmin` (highest level)
  - permissions on resource classes and property combination (own
    project)
  - permissions on resource classes and property combination
    (`knora-admin:SystemProject`)
  - permissions on resource classes / properties (own project)
  - permissions on resource classes / properties
    (`knora-admin:SystemProject`)
  - permissions on custom groups
  - permissions on `knora-admin:ProjectMember`
  - permissions on `knora-admin:KnownUser` (lowest level)

The permissions on resource classes / properties are only relevant for
default object access permissions.

**Administrative Permissions**: When a user performs an operation
requiring administrative permissions, then **only** the permissions from
the **highest level** are taken into account. If a user is a member of
more than one group on the same level (only possible for custom groups)
then the defined permissions are summed up and all are taken into
account.

**Default Object Access Permissions**: When a user creates a resource or
value, then **only** the default object permissions from the **highest
level** are applied. If a user is a member of more than one group on the
same level (only possible for custom groups) then the defined
permissions are summed up and the most permissive are applied.

In the case of users belonging to the **SystemAdmin** group, but which
are not members of a project and thus no group belonging to the project,
the *default object access permissions* from the **highest defined
level** will apply.

In the case of users belonging to the **SystemAdmin group**, but which
are not members of a project and thus not members of any group belonging
to the project, the *default object access permissions* from the
**ProjectAdmin**, **ProjectMember**, or **KnownUser** group will be
applied in the order of precedence. If no permissions are defined on
either of these groups, then the resulting permission will be `CR
knora-admin:Creator`.

Also, in the case that no *default object access permissions* are
defined for the project, the resulting permission will be `CR
knora-admin:Creator`.

## Implicit Permissions

The `knora-admin:SystemAdmin` group receives implicitly the following
permissions:

  - receives implicitly *ProjectAllAdminPermission* for all projects.
  - receives implicitly *ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission* for all
    projects.
  - receives implicitly *CR* on all objects from all projects.

Theses permissions are baked into the system, and cannot be changed.

## Permission Templates

The permission capabilities of Knora are very large, as it needs to be
able to satisfy a broad set of requirements. To simplify permission
management for the users, we provide permission templates, which can be
used during creation of new projects, or applied to existing projects. A
permission template defines a set of administrative and default object
access permission. Currently, two different templates will be defined
*OPEN*, *CLOSED*.

### Template: OPEN

The *OPEN* template defines the following permissions:

- The `knora-admin:ProjectAdmin` group:

      - receives explicitly *ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission*.
      - receives explicitly *ProjectAllAdminPermission*.

- The `knora-admin:ProjectMember` group:

      - receives explicitly *ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission*.
      - receives explicitly *CR* for the *knora-admin:Creator* and
        *knora-admin:ProjectAdmin* group.
      - receives explicitly *M* for the *ProjectMember* group.
      - receives explicitly *V* for the *knora-admin:KnownUser*
        group.

### Template: CLOSED

The *CLOSED* template, defined the following permissions:

- The `knora-admin:ProjectAdmin` group:

      - receives explicitly *ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission*.
      - receives explicitly *ProjectAllAdminPermission*.

- The `knora-admin:ProjectMember` group:

      - receives explicitly *ProjectResourceCreateAllPermission*.
      - receives explicitly *CR* for the *knora-admin:ProjectAdmin*
        group.
      - receives explicitly *M* for the *ProjectMember* group.

## Default Permissions Matrix for new Projects

The access control matrix defines what are the default operations a
*subject* (i.e. User), being a member of a built-in group (represented
by row headers), is permitted to perform on an *object* (represented by
column headers). The different operation abbreviations used are defined
as follows:

  - *C*: *Create* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *create* the object.

  - *U*: *Update* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *update* the object.

  - *R*: *Read* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *read* **all** information about the object.

  - *D*: *Delete* - the subject inside the group is allowed to *delete* the object.

  - *P*: *Permission* - the subject inside the group is allowed to change the *permissions* on the object.

  - *-*: *none* - none or not applicable

| Built-In Group    | Project | Group   | User                | Resource               | Value                |
| ----------------- | ------- | ------- | ------------------- | ---------------------- | -------------------- |
| **SystemAdmin**   | `CRUD`  | `CRUDP` | `CRUDP` all         | `CRUDP` all            | `CRUDP` all          |
| **ProjectAdmin**  | `-RUD`  | `CRUDP` | `CRUDP` +/- project | `CRUDP` (in project)   | `CRUDP` (in project) |
| **ProjectMember** | `----`  | `-----` | `-----`             | `CRUD-` (in project)   | `-----` (in project) |
| **Creator**       | `----`  | `-----` | `-----`             | `-RUDP` (his resource) | `-----` (his value)  |
| **KnownUser**     | `C---`  | `C----` | `CRUD-` himself     | `R----` (in project)   | `R----` (in project) |

### Project / Group Administration

![Figure 1](administration-fig3.dot.png "Figure 3")

## Implementation

The requirements for defining default permissions imposed by all the
different use cases are very broad. Potentially, we need to be able to
define default permissions per project, per group, per resource class,
per resource property, and all their possible combinations.

For this reason, we introduce the *knora-admin:Permission* class with two
sub-classes, namely *knora-admin:AdministrativePermission* and
*knora-admin:DefaultObjectAccessPermission*, which instances will carry
all the necessary information.

### Permission Class Hierarchy and Structure

The following graphs show the class hierarchy and the structure of each
permission class.

                                CR <http://rdfh.ch/groups/[shortcode]/[UUID]>"^^xsd:string .
```

### Querying Permission Instances

The properties **forProject** and either of **forGroup**,
**forResourceClass**, and **forProperty** form together a *compound
key*, allowing finding existing permission instances, that address the
same set of Project / Group / ResourceClass / Property combination, thus
making it possible to extend or change the attached permissions.

**Administrative Permission Instances**: For each group inside the
project, there can be **zero** or **one** instance holding
administrative permission information. Querying is straitforward by
using the *knora-admin:forProject* and *knora-admin:forGroup* properties
as the compound key.

**Default Object Access Permission Instances**: For each group, resource
class, or property inside the project, there can be **zero** or **one**
instances holding default object access permission informations.
Querying is straitforward by using the *knora-admin:forProject* and
either *knora-admin:forGroup*, *knora-admin:forResourceClass*, or
*knora-admin:forProperty* properties as part of the compound key.

A the time the user's `UserProfile` is queried, all permissions for all
projects and groups the user is a member of are also queried. This
information is then stored as an easy accessible object inside the
`UserProfile`, being readily available wherever needed. As this is a
somewhat expensive operation, built-in caching mechanism at different
levels (e.g., UsersResponder, PermissionsResponder), will be applied.

## Use Cases

### UC01: Teaching a Class

  - **Description**:  
    I'm teaching a class and I have the names and email addresses of all
    the students. I want to create a project, divide the students into
    groups (which will only be relevant to this project, e.g. one group
    for each section of the class), and put some students in each group.
    I don't want people to be able to join the project or the group by
    themselves.

  - **Solution**:  
    The teacher creates different groups and adds users to those groups.
    Additionally, the teacher can give TA's *GroupAdmin* privileges, and
    let the TA's add students to the different groups.

### UC02: Unibas Librarian

  - **Description**:  
    I'm a Unibas librarian managing several archiving projects. I need
    to give everyone at the university permission to view all these
    projects. I want to create a group called *UnibasUser* that everyone
    with a Unibas email address will automatically belong to. Most of
    the resources in those projects can then grant view permission to
    *UnibasUser*. Or perhaps the group will be *SwitchUser*, for anyone
    at a Swiss university. Or something even broader.

  - **Solution**:  
    These can be solved by creating *Smart Groups*, where the user can
    define what properties need to be set, so that an user is
    automatically part of this group. This will be implemented at a
    later time, as it is not trivial and should also include all special
    groups (e.g., KnownUser, ProjectMember, ProjectAdmin, etc.) that are
    currently hard-coded inside the system.

### UC03: Crowdsourcing Project

  - **Description**:  
    I'm doing a crowdsourcing project, which involves several different
    groups that work on different tasks. I'm hoping for thousands of
    users, and I'd like anyone to be able to join the project and add
    themselves to any group they want (as long as Knora verifies their
    email address), without needing approval from me.

  - **Solution**:  
    This can be solved by allowing self-assignment to a group.

### UC04: User "left" Knora

  - **Description**:  
    An user who was an active collaborator, decides to "quit", and wants
    to delete his user.

  - **Solution**:  
    The user's IRI is saved on each value change as part of the
    versioning mechanism. Exchanging the user's IRI in those places
    would count as 'rewriting history'. So deleting a user will not be
    possible, instead the user will be set as `not active`.

## Redesign / Questions June 2016

  - **Permissions constrained to groups**

      - Why this constraint?
      - This is just the way we are doing it. Makes it a bit
        simpler.

**Resource owner permission to disruptive**

  - knora-base:attachedToUser gives owner status to the person who
    created the resource.
  - **Proposed change:** remove this altogether or make
    institution/project owner of the resource.
  - Should hiwis be "owners" of resources they create on behalf of
    their professor?
  - If the creator should have max permission, then give it
    explicitly.
  - Owner will be renamed to creator. We need this for
    provenance. Does not give any permissions automatically. The
    permissions depend on what is defined for the project and the
    *creator* smart group.

**Resource creation permission to course**

  - being part of a projects gives resource creation permission. What
    if some project members are not allowed to create new resources
    (or only certain types; Lumiere Lausanne requirement), but are
    only allowed to change existing resources?
  - These kind of permissions can be set on groups. A project can
    have different groups, giving different kind of permissions.

**Support Default Permissions**

  - Allow for a project to define permissions that a newly created
    resource inside a project should receive (current Salsah behavior)
  - Lumiere Lausanne requirement
  - Will be allowed.

**Groups**

  - Do groups belong to projects, i.e. are they seen as extensions to
    projects?
  - Does someone need to be part of a project to belong to a group of
    that project?
  - Every group needs to belong to a project. No GroupAdmins.
    ProjectAdmins with additional GroupAdmin permissions.

**root**

  - Should the 'root' / SystemAdmin user have 'implicitly' or
    'explicitly' all permissions?
  - Has implicitly all permissions.
  - Does the has all permissions also extend to projects? Is the root
    user going to be part of every project? If yes, then again
    implicitly or explicitly?
  - Since 'root' / SystemAdmin already has all permissions,
    doesn't really matter if part of a project or group

**Ivan's Use Case**

  - The system administrator creates the project and sets Ivan as the
    project administrator. As the project administrator, I have all
    permissions on all objects (Resources/Values; Project Groups)
    belonging to the project (knora-base:attachedToProject). Nobody
    outside of the project should be allowed to see anything that is
    created as part of Ivan's project. He wants to be able to create
    two groups: *Reviewer*, *Creator*. The *Reviewer* group should
    only give *read-access* to someone inside the group to resources
    pointing to this group, but allow the creation of annotations.
    Further, annotations should only be readable by users inside the
    *Reviewer* group. The *Creator* group should give a user create
    permission and modify permission on the objects the user has
    created. Any resources created belong to the project. The
    *Creator* group is meant for contributors helping out with the
    project, e.g., Hiwis.
  - Covered

**Lausanne Projects**

  - A project wants to restrict the permissions of newly created
    resources to a fixed set
  - Covered. Will be able do define 'default permissions' and
    restrict the creation of new resources to these permissions
  - This means for the current implementation, that any permissions
    supplied during the resource creation request need to be checked
    and if needed overriden.
  - Covered. Also in the new design, the backend will need to
    always check the suplied permissions for newly created resources
    as we cannot ve sure that the GUI will behave correctly (e.g.,
    many different "Salsah" implementations)
  - Restrict creation/access of certain classes of resources to
    certain groups, e.g., group A is able to create/access resources
    of class A but not of class B.
  - Covered. Will be able to give a certain group only create
    permission for specific classes

**Results**

  - *Owner* renamed to *Creator*
  - Some permissions are attached to groups (e.g., Add Resource
    (Class), Modify Ontology, etc.), and some are attached to
    resources (e.g., this group has read/modify permission, etc.)
  - Ontologien Benutzung einschränken (nur auf bestimmte Gruppen, oder
    frei zur Verfügung)
  - System Admin Rechte implizit
  - Gruppen immer an Projekt gebunden
  - Keine Gruppen-Admins. Soll über Rollen vom Projekt-Admin geregelt
    werden können.
