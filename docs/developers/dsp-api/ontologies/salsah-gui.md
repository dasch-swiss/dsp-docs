# The SALSAH GUI Ontology

## Overview

The SALSAH GUI ontology provides entities that can be used in
user-created ontologies to indicate to SALSAH (or to another GUI)
how data should be entered and displayed.

The SALSAH GUI ontology is identified by the IRI
`http://www.knora.org/ontology/salsah-gui`. In the DSP-API documentation
in general, it is identified by the prefix `salsah-gui`, but for
brevity, we omit the prefix in this document.

## Properties

`guiOrder`

:   Can be attached to an `owl:Restriction` representing a cardinality
    in a resource class, to indicate the order in which properties
    should be displayed in the GUI. The object is a non-negative
    integer. For example, a property with `guiOrder` 0 would be
    displayed first, followed by a property with `guiOrder` 1, and so
    on.

`guiElement`

:   Can be attached to a property definition to indicate which SALSAH
    GUI element should be used to enter data for the property. This
    should be one of the individuals of class `Guielement` described
    below.

`guiAttribute`

:   Can be attached to a property definition to provide attributes for
    the GUI element specified in `guiElement`. The objects of this
    predicate are written in a DSL with the following syntax:

```ebnf
object = attribute name, "=", attribute value ;

attribute name = identifier ;

identifier = letter , { letter } ;

attribute value = integer | decimal | percent | string | iri ;

percent = integer, "%" ;

iri = "<", string, ">" ;
```

The attributes used with each GUI element are described below under
[Individuals](#individuals).

`guiAttributeDefinition`

:   Used only in the `salsah-gui` ontology itself, as a predicate
    attached to instances of `Guielement` (see [Individuals](#individuals)),
    to specify the attributes that can be given as objects of `guiAttribute` when a given
    `Guielement`. is used. The objects of this predicate are written in
    a DSL with the following syntax:

```ebnf
object = attribute name, [ "(required)" ], ":", attribute type, [ enumerated values ] ;

enumerated values = "(", enumerated value, { "|", enumerated value } ")" ;

attribute name = identifier ;

attribute type = "integer" | "decimal" | "percent" | "string" | "iri" ;

enumerated value = identifier ;

identifier = letter , { letter } ;
```

    Enumerated values are allowed only if `attribute type` is `string`.
    If enumerated values are provided for an attribute, the attribute
    value given via `guiAttribute` must be one of the enumerated values.

## Classes

`Guielement`

:   The instances of this class are individuals representing SALSAH GUI
    elements for data entry.

## Individuals

`Colorpicker`

:   A GUI element for selecting a color. A property definition that uses
    this element may also contain a `guiAttribute` predicate whose
    object is a string in the form `"ncolors=N"`, where `N` is an
    integer specifying the number of colors to display.

`Date`

:   A GUI element for selecting a date.

`Geometry`

:   A GUI element for selecting the geometry of a two-dimensional
    region.

`Geonames`

:   A GUI element for selecting a [Geonames](http://www.geonames.org/)
    identifier.

`Interval`

:   A GUI element for selecting a time interval in an audio or video
    recording.

`List`

:   A GUI element for selecting an item in a hierarchical list (see
    [ListValue](knora-base.md#listvalue)). A property definition that
    uses this element must also contain this `guiAttribute` predicate:

    -   `"hlist=<LIST_IRI>"`, where `LIST_IRI` is the IRI of a
        `knora-base:ListNode` that is the root node of a hierarchical list.

`Pulldown`

:   A GUI element for selecting an item in a flat list (see
    [ListValue](knora-base.md#listvalue)) using a pull-down menu. A
    property definition that uses this element must also contain this
    `guiAttribute` predicate:

    -   `"hlist=<LIST_IRI>"`, where `LIST_IRI` is the IRI of a
        `knora-base:ListNode` that is the root node of a hierarchical list.

`Radio`

:   A GUI element for selecting an item in a flat list (see
    [ListValue](knora-base.md#listvalue)) using radio buttons. A property
    definition that uses this element must also contain this
    `guiAttribute` predicate:

    -   `"hlist=<LIST_IRI>"`, where `LIST_IRI` is the IRI of a
        `knora-base:ListNode` that is the root node of a hierarchical list.

`Richtext`

:   A GUI element for editing multi-line formatted text.

`Searchbox`

:   A GUI element for searching for a resource by matching text in its
    `rdfs:label`. For DSP API v1, a property definition that uses this
    element may also contain this `guiAttribute` predicate:

    -   `"numprops=N"`, where `N` is an integer specifying the number of
        describing properties to be returned for each found resource.

    For DSP API v2, the `guiAttribute` has no effect.

`SimpleText`

:   A GUI element for editing a single line of unformatted text. A
    property definition that uses this element may also contain a
    `guiAttribute` predicate with one or both of the following objects:

    -   `"size=N"`, where `N` is an integer specifying the size of the
        text field.
    -   `"maxlength=N"`, where `N` is an integer specifying the maximum
        length of the string to be input.

`Slider`

:   A GUI element for choosing numerical values using a slider. A
    property definition that uses this element must also contain a
    `guiAttribute` predicate with both of the following objects:

    -   `"min=N"`, where `N` is an integer specifying the minimum value
        of the input.
    -   `"max=N"`, where `N` is an integer specifying the maximum value
        of the input.

`Spinbox`

:   A GUI element for choosing numerical values using a spinbox. A
    property definition that uses this element may also contain a
    `guiAttribute` predicate with one or both of the following objects:

    -   `"min=N"`, where `N` is an integer specifying the minimum value
        of the input.
    -   `"max=N"`, where `N` is an integer specifying the maximum value
        of the input.

`Textarea`

:   A GUI element for editing multi-line unformatted text. A property
    definition that uses this element may also contain a `guiAttribute`
    predicate with one or more of the following objects:

    -   `"width=N"`, where `N` is a percentage of the window width (an
        integer followed by `%`).
    -   `"cols=N"`, where `N` is an integer representing the number of
        colums in the text entry box.
    -   `"rows=N"`, where `N` is an integer specifying the height of the
        text entry box in rows.
    -   `"wrap=W"`, where `W` is `soft` or `hard` (see
        [wrap](https://www.w3.org/TR/html5/sec-forms.html#element-attrdef-textarea-wrap)).

`Checkbox`

:   A GUI element for choosing a boolean value using a checkbox.

`Fileupload`

:   A GUI element for uploading a file.
